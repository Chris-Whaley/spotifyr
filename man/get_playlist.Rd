\title{Get a playlist owned by a Spotify user.}
\usage{
get_playlist(playlist_id, fields = NULL, market = NULL,
  Authorization = get_spotify_access_token())
}
\arguments{
\item{playlist_id}{Required. The \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify ID} for the playlist.}

\item{fields}{Optional. Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the playlistâ€™s description and URI: \code{fields = c("description", "uri")}. A dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and user ID of the adder: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(added_at,added_by.id)"}. Use multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(track(name,href,album(name,href)))"}. Fields can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(track(name,href,album(!name,href)))"}.}

\item{market}{Optional. \cr
An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code or the string \code{"from_token"}. Provide this parameter if you want to apply \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide/}{Track Relinking}}

\item{Authorization}{Required. A valid access token from the Spotify Accounts service. See the \href{Web API Authorization Guide}{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/} for more details. Both Public and Private playlists belonging to any user are retrievable on provision of a valid access token. Defaults to \code{spotifyr::get_spotify_access_token()}}
