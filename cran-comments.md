## To reviewer

The package has been on CRAN for a very long time without changes, and eventually archived a short while ago. This is a long overdue minor release that fixes such issues without changing functionality.  This means fixing dozens of broken links, removing deprecated dependencies, and improving non-standard evaluation to current best practices.
